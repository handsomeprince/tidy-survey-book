# Corrections and remarks {#corrections-remarks}

These errata are in the print version. They have been corrected in the online version.

## Chapter 2

The word **broad** not **board** should be in the following sentence. "If we are looking at more **broad** populations of interest, like all adults in the United States, the sampling frame is likely imperfect."

## Chapter 4

The word **function** should be **factor** in the following sentence. "The `dplyr::glimpse()` function produces a list of all variables, their types (e.g., factor, double), and a few example values." Thank you to [@handsomeprince](https://github.com/handsomeprince) for reporting.

## Appendix A.3 {-}

Stata files have the extension of `.dta`. There are a few instances of using the function `read_dat()` instead of `read_dta()` on Page 315.
